    What makes RoomMagnet different?
RoomMagnet provides an easy to use platform where pre-screened Tenants and Hosts come together, and in exchange for a modest cost and/or in exchange for light domestic duties, enjoy reduced rent. It’s a win-win! Hosts monetize their extra living space and if they wish get a little help around the house. Tenants enjoy affordable housing.
Who can use Roommagnet
Roommagnet users must be at least 18 years of age and are seeking a minimum of 30 days stay in Host lodging. While Roommagnet is open to all who meet their minimum requirements we specialize in connecting Hosts with professional and semi-professionals such as, graduate students, international students, doctoral and nursing interns as well as college students seeking affordable off campus housing.
Who are host families?
Host families are those who have room in their home, empty-nesters and people of advanced age who wish to age in place, and wish to monetize their empty space. In cases where hosts are interested in getting a little help around the house and tenants are willing  provide assistance with things such as light domestic or outdoor work, running errands, as well as companionship a further rent discount will be offered by the host and negotiated between host and tenant.
What is the advantage to a host family
Roommagnet connects host families who wish to share empty space in their home with responsible inter-generational adults who seek affordable housing in order to continue their careers. These may be advanced college students, doctoral and nursing interns, international students or professionals. Host families have the assurance that Tenants are carefully screened.
Hosts who need assistance with light domestic duties (i.e. shopping, household odd jobs, daily maintenance or just companionship) will offer further discount for assistance.
Why is there a need for RoomMagnet?
As the cost of housing increases and become more scare in highly populated areas, it becomes harder for responsible students, as well as professional and semi-professionals (ie: doctoral interns, and interning nurses) to find suitable and affordable housing. Likewise, International students not only have the added expense of international living, but also must adjust to the cultural landscape of the U.S., which living with a host family can greatly reduce.

What is RoomMagnet’s HomeshareSmarter® Living option?
Tenants who are open to assisting host families with some basic chores like running errands, doing yard work or just providing companionship or personal assistance will receive a discount on their housing. We call this HomeShareSmarter® Living.

Who are RoomMagnet’s Advisors?
Our advisors are available to assist hosts who would rather sit back and experience the benefits of the RoomMagnet program but not the hassle of getting set up. E-mail us today and let us set up a personal meeting with one of our advisors to walk you through the process. It’s that easy!

What is RoomMagnet’s background screening procedure?
We require all RoomMagnet users ( Tenants and Hosts) who wish to connect on our platform  to initiate a background check. We ask this so that our users feel secure in taking advantage of the benefits of RoomMagnet. Hosts or Tenants may request, and rely upon one or more consumer reports or investigative consumer reports to determine a compatible living arrangement. Should either Host or Tenants not choose to initiate a background screen, either party may continue to search the site to find a compatible match, however before a match is consummated a background screen must be initiated.
What is the cost of my criminal background check?
RoomMagnet has selected a criminal background company that follows the Federal Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) regulations. The background information is obtained from the consumer reporting agency, IntelliCorp Records, Inc. which can be contacted by mail at 3000 Auburn Dr, Suite 410;Beachwood, OH 44122; or phone: 1-888-946-8355; or website: www.intellicorp.net
The cost of securing your criminal background check with Intellicorp is $24.95. (Use this link to
begin your criminal background check. Be sure to enter the password located below link:
Intellicorp Records will provide a link to request copy of your background report once it is completed .

What is the cost of becoming part of the RoomMagnet community?
RoomMagnet does not charge either Tenants or Hosts a fee to register, develop a profile, list a property or search. Upon a confirmed letter of intent, tenants will be required to pay the first and last month’s rent.

RoomMagnet earns a match fee of one month’s rent once Host and Tenants connect and initiate the company’s letter of intent indicating a desirable match and a start date for occupancy. 
Such commission will be deducted from the first month’s base rental rate with the balance then forwarded to the host. On Lease agreements that are sixty (60) days or less Roommagnet will only require a 30% commission of the total lease term rental.

Why do we use Stripe to disperse payments?
Stripe is a recognized secure payment platform that works similar to Paypal in that it collects payments from RoomMagnet Renters (Tenants) and automatically disperses funds to Landlords (Hosts). In order for RoomMagnet to disperse funds, landlords (hosts) will need to set up a simple stripe account. This will enable RoomMagnet to distribute funds directly and quickly to the account provided. Stripe is a network with redundant security encryption, and all information is kept strictly confidential. For more information on stripe visit www.stripe.com.

        Why do I need a background screen?
Trust is a quality we all value. We at RoomMagnet understand that it is the most important
aspect of the relationship between Hosts and Tenants. Consequently, RoomMagnet through
Intellicorp Records Inc. provides a background screening capability for its users. (please see our
FAQ’s for a description of the background screening procedure). All background screenings are
performed according to FCRA regulations.
We require that both Hosts and Tenants initiate a background screening and
encourage both who are contemplating a living arrangement to share this information.
This will give other users that extra comfort in knowing a little more about those whom they’re
considering sharing a home.
Please keep in mind that once a connection is made users may agree to share personal
background information. However it is only for their use only, and not to be shared with any
third party.
We know that nothing in life is 100% perfect. The comprehensive background screening is
performed by an experienced third party with the results provided to RoomMagnet. The results
are based solely on the information available in their normal screening process.
To initiate a personal background screen click the link below and when prompted enter the
password: roommagnet33
