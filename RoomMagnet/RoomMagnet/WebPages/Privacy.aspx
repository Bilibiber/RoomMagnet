                    <p>We may review, scan, or analyze your communications on the RoomMagnet Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research, analytics, and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other websites. </p>
                    <p>In some cases, we may also scan, review, or analyze messages to debug, improve, and expand product offerings. We use automated methods where reasonably possible. However, occasionally we may need to manually review some communications, such as fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools. We will not review, scan, or analyze your messaging communications to send third party messages to you, and we will not sell reviews or analyses of these communications.</p>
